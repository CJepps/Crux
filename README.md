# [Crux - Training for climbers](link)
<img src="static/img/readme/crux-amiresponsive.jpg">


 In this project I will create a full-stack ecommerce website to sell climbing training programs for a climbing club.
 The website will feature: a shop in which to buy and access pre-made training programs, a forum in which registered users can communicate, and the ability for users to become members, thus enabling all content on the website.
